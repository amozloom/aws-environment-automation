# üå©Ô∏è AWS Environment Automation

This project automates the provisioning and management of AWS cloud infrastructure using a Java Spring Boot backend. Built as part of an academic project, it exposes a RESTful API to orchestrate environments, EC2 instances, and network components like VPCs and subnets.

## üì¶ Project Overview

The system is designed with modular services and DTOs to handle API requests for:
- Launching VPCs and Subnets
- Deploying and managing EC2 instances
- Starting, stopping, and terminating resources
- Querying environment and instance metadata

It integrates with the AWS Java SDK and follows a clean architecture pattern using controllers, services, and models.
